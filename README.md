# Project 2 - Ray creation

This is a project to Computer Graphics I class (DIM0451-UFRN).

In this project, we're creating the ray projection over the image.

## Compile

`g++ main.cpp -o main`

## Execute

`./main <input_file_name>.xml`

## Results

The image with just a single color can be found in `simple_bkg.ppm`; and the image with the four colors gradient in `interpolated_bkg.ppm`.

_The image wasn't posted as img here cause git does't support ppm type._
