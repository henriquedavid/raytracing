# Project 1 - Basic Infrastructure

This is a project to Computer Graphics I class (DIM0451-UFRN).

In this project, it was necessary to create the basic infrastructure to make the ray tracing. The first project was divided in just two steps, but it's necessary another step, before everything, that wasn't note it in the project, but it was asked, that is the ParamSet class.

The ParamSet is a class that it's gonna help us to take the inputs of an external file, responsible to create our configuration and our world, that is pass in XML format. The class saves in a dictionary the attributes (keys and values) and then we begin to configure everything that we need.  

The next step of the project, we had to generate an image with just a single background color (light blue sky). And in the third step, we had to generate another image with 4 input colors, then we make an interpolation and we generate a beautiful gradient of those input colors, being each color in each corner of the rectangle.

All images generated has type ppm, for more performance.

## Results

The image with just a single color can be found in `simple_bkg.ppm`; and the image with the four color gradient in `interpolated_bkg.ppm`.

_The image wasn't posted as img here cause git does't support ppm type._
